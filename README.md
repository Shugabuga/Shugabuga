### Hi, I'm Shuga. 👋

I'm a developer, graphic designer, and a video editor from the United States.

I'm most known for my work within the iOS jailbreaking community, but I also write things with bots and other miscellaneous code.

- 🛠 [**Silica**](https://github.com/Shugabuga/Silica/) is a static site generator for iOS APT repos.
- 🤖 [**Cathode**](https://github.com/Shugabuga/Cathode) is a modular Discord bot boilerplate that is used by [ShugaBot](https://shuga.co/discord/).

- 📈 [**shugaStatus**](https://github.com/Shugabuga/shugaStatus) is an uptime page that interacts with [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com/).
- 📝 I also wrote much of the documentation for [Sileo's](https://github.com/Sileo) [**native depiction**](https://github.com/Sileo/DeveloperDocumentation) format.

I also am a member of [Zenith](/ZenithDevs/), a team of young developers who focus on pushing the limits of iOS.
